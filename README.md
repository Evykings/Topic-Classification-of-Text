# üìö Text Classification Project  
A Data Science project leveraging Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify textual data into predefined categories. This project demonstrates end-to-end workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## üìù Project Overview  
This project aims in leveraging machine learning to analyze and classify paragraph-sized text submissions into specific topics. By automating this process, the organization can better categorize content and enhance user experience on their platform. This project explores a robust approach to text classification by applying machine learning algorithms to process and categorize textual data efficiently.

### Key Objectives:  
- **Preprocessing textual data**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization.  
- **Feature extraction**: Leveraging TF-IDF and word embeddings for vector representation.  
- **Modeling**: Training machine learning classifiers (SGDClassifier and MultinomialNB).  
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing  
1. **Text Cleaning**:  
   - Removed special characters, punctuations, and HTML tags.  
   - Converted text to lowercase for consistency.  

2. **Tokenization**:  
   - Split text into individual words or tokens.  

3. **Stop-Word Removal**:  
   - Removed commonly used words with little contextual meaning (e.g., "the," "and").  

4. **Stemming/Lemmatization**:  
   - Reduced words to their base or root form.  

5. **Vectorization**:  
   - Implemented **TF-IDF** for traditional models.  
   - Used **word embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) for deep learning approaches.
