# üìö Text Classification Project  
A Data Science project leveraging Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify textual data into predefined categories. This project demonstrates end-to-end workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## üìù Project Overview  
Text classification is a fundamental task in NLP with applications ranging from sentiment analysis to spam detection. This project explores a robust approach to text classification by applying machine learning algorithms to process and categorize textual data efficiently.

### Key Objectives:  
- **Preprocessing textual data**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization.  
- **Feature extraction**: Leveraging TF-IDF and word embeddings for vector representation.  
- **Modeling**: Training machine learning classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) and deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, BERT).  
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üìä Dataset Description  
The dataset used in this project includes textual content and their corresponding labels for classification.  

### Dataset Features:  
- **Text**: The primary input data to be classified.  
- **Label**: The target variable indicating the class of each text.  

### Source:  
The dataset is sourced from [public datasets like Kaggle, UCI, etc., or specify your source if applicable].  

### Dataset Statistics:  
- **Number of Samples**: [e.g., 10,000 records]  
- **Number of Classes**: [e.g., 5 categories]  
- **Class Distribution**: Visualized in the EDA section below.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Explored text length distributions, word frequency analysis, and class distributions.  
- Visualized insights using word clouds and bar plots.  
- Uncovered potential data imbalances and prepared for feature engineering.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing  
1. **Text Cleaning**:  
   - Removed special characters, punctuations, and HTML tags.  
   - Converted text to lowercase for consistency.  

2. **Tokenization**:  
   - Split text into individual words or tokens.  

3. **Stop-Word Removal**:  
   - Removed commonly used words with little contextual meaning (e.g., "the," "and").  

4. **Stemming/Lemmatization**:  
   - Reduced words to their base or root form.  

5. **Vectorization**:  
   - Implemented **TF-IDF** for traditional models.  
   - Used **word embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) for deep learning approaches.

## üß† Model Building  
Implemented and evaluated multiple models:  

1. **Baseline Models**:  
   - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest.  

2. **Advanced Models**:  
   - LSTMs and Transformers (e.g., BERT).  

### Model Performance:  
| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |  
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|  
| Logistic Regression | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx%      |  
| Naive Bayes         | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx%      |  
| LSTM                | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx%      |  
| BERT                | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    | xx%      |
