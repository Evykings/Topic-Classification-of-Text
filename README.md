## üìù Project Overview  
This project aims in leveraging machine learning to analyze and classify paragraph-sized text submissions into specific topics. By automating this process, the organization can better categorize content and enhance user experience on their platform. This project explores a robust approach to text classification by applying machine learning algorithms to process and categorize textual data efficiently.

### Key Objectives:  
- **Preprocessing textual data**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization.  
- **Feature extraction**: Leveraging TF-IDF and word embeddings for vector representation.  
- **Modeling**: Training machine learning classifiers (SGDClassifier and MultinomialNB).  
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
